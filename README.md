## What is it?
Background color picker that changes the color Red to blue, blue to Red. There is also a Home where you started where red and blue are the background colors.
I used a React router to change the background color, but what's happening is that the page is just turning to a different file document.

## What the purpose:
The purpose of this is to demonstrate how React Router and how it works.
This is good React.js practice and development knowledge. You can see all the 
great benefits that React Router gives you in your project.

## What is my Stack?
 - React + Vite
 - JSX JavaScript
 - CSS

>[!NOTE]
>  This is just an Example for React Router
